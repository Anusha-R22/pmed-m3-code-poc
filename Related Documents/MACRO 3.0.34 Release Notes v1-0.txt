STATUS OF RELEASE
=================
This release is provided for acceptance testing and evaluation only and should not be used in a production system.



NEW IN VERSION 3.0
==================

1.	EDC

MACRO Electronic Data Collection (formerly data entry and review modules) has been re-designed to improve navigation between eForms, visits and subjects and to provide more visual feedback and status indicators to the data entry user.

New icons on data entry forms show which questions have discrepancies, comments, SDVs have been changed previously and are locked or frozen.

The study designer can choose whether icons are displayed or not for each question; if derived questions are being displayed for information only it may not be necessary to display a status icon.

Data entry forms may be in portrait or landscape format.

Hotlinks can be created by the study designer to allow the data entry user to navigate quickly to different eForms by clicking on a hyperlink.

The user may choose to work in split screen mode, displaying eForms in the top half of the screen and discrepancies, SDV or audit trail data in the bottom half.

Multi-user data entry has been enhanced, so that 2 or more users can enter data for the same subject concurrently.

When the value of a derived field changes, MACRO will automatically insert a reason for change in the audit trail for that question.  Similarly, if a question is enabled or disabled an automatic reason for change will be inserted.

It is possible to set eForms or visits to be ‘unobtainable’.  

When the user overrules a warning generated by a validation check, they must enter a reason for overruling, or select from a list specified by the study designer.

All validation checks on a form will be automatically re-run when the form is saved, to avoid possible inconsistencies with multi-variate cross-checks on the form.

The user can move between different subject records while keeping the same eForm open.  Also, a different user can log in to MACRO while keeping the current subject record open (the 'switch' function).

The electronic signature function has been enhanced so that the signature is always required, even if the user has the correct role.  Hence only 1 user name and password is required for each user who can authorise.  The full name of the user can be displayed on the eForm, in compliance with regulatory requirements.

The text of discrepancies has been increased to a maximum of 2000 characters.

Locking and freezing transactions have been removed from the main MACRO audit trail, and are recorded and transferred separately.  A new function to unfreeze data has been added.


2.	AUDIT TRAIL

The MACRO audit trail has been extended to include the time zone of the local machine, and also the time zone and timestamp of the database server, so that the correct chronology of events can be readily reconstructed.

Form dates and visit dates are now included in the audit trail.  Form and visit dates can now have formatting, derivations and validations specified in the study definition, and can have comments, discrepancies and SDV marks raised against them.

Users may choose to display and enter dates in a format other than that specifed in the study definition.


3.	REPEATING QUESTION GROUPS

Repeating question groups, or tables, can be specified and the study definition, and provide a convenient way to collect repeating data sets such as concomitant medications.

The number of rows displayed and the maximum number of rows can be specified.  Each question may be validated independently.  Questions in repeating question groups may be derived.


4.	SOURCE DATA VERIFICATION

Source Data Verification (SDV) marks can now be created at question, form, visit and subject level.  Each SDV mark can indicate that SDV is planned, queried, done or cancelled.  Icons on eForms and the schedule indicate where SDV marks have been made.


5.	STUDY DEFINITION

The study designer may select groups of questions to move, copy and paste, align, or change fonts, etc.

The study designer can configure new default settings controlling attributes of questions, such as reason for change, status icon display, numbering and use of option buttons for category questions.

The font and colour of question captions may be set independently of the font and colour of the question value.

The size of a data entry text box can be specified, so that it can be shorter than the maximum number of characters allowable for the question (to conserve screen space) or longer (to improve layout and appearance of eForms).

A new expression editor helps the study designer to construct validations, derivations and other expressions.

Questions may be flagged as 'MACRO Only' and not for transfer to Oracle Clinical.  A new attribute can be used to record metadata information for questions.

AREZZO memory settings can be specified separately for each study.


6.	SYSTEM MANAGEMENT

A new user interface provides better visualization of databases, studies, sites, users and user roles for system managers.

All security information can be managed centrally and will be synchronized with offline sites with the transfer of data.  Password policies can also be maintained centrally.

At an offline site, authorised users can set up new user accounts and reset passwords.  This information will be synchronised with the server.

Version control across different sites has been improved, facilitating easier deployment of new study versions to specific sites as they gain IRB approval.

All functions which previously were accessed from MACRO Exchange have been moved to System Management.  MACRO Exchange no longer exists as a separate module.


7.	STUDY PORTAL

Each user may have a customised home page, providing access to static and dynamic information.  The home page may be an html page, or dynamic content technology such as Active Server Pages or php, etc.  If Active Server Pages are used on offline data entry machines, IIS 5.0 must be installed on these machines.  Other dynamic content technologies may require additional software.

The contents of the home page, and associated linked documents may be different for different users, user roles, sites or studies.

The contents of the home page, and associated linked documents, may be synchronised between the server and offline sites, so that new content is downloaded to the sites when they perform a data transfer.


8.	REPORTS

New reports are available to display and print information from the MACRO security system, study metadata and clinical data.  

The reports are delivered as Active Server Pages.  


9.	BATCH DATA ENTRY

The batch data entry module now imports data including repeating question groups, and can be used to create batches of new subject records.


10.	QUERY MODULE

The query module supports repeating question groups and now includes support for SAS exports.


11.	CREATE DATA VIEWS

Separate data views are created for repeating question groups.



INSTALLATION
============
To install MACRO 3.0, run setup.exe and follow the on-screen instructions.

NOTE:  MACRO 3.0 is only supported on Windows 2000 and Windows XP, with IE 5.5 or 6.0 (see later).  MACRO 3.0 may install on other versions of the Windows operating system, but additional installation steps may be necessary.  Further information can be provided on request.

The MACRO 3.0 installation package does not install a database system.  Before running MACRO 3.0, a local or network database (Oracle 8.1.7, SQLSERVER 2000 or MSDE 2000) must be available.  MACRO 3.0 does not require the JET database libraries to be installed.  MDAC will be installed automatically.

When installing MACRO 3.0 on a machine which is running IIS, the IIS process should be stopped and re-started before installing MACRO 3.0.

A default printer driver should be installed on all machines that will run MACRO.

On installation, a default user account named 'rde' will be created.  This should be used to log into MACRO and to create system administrator account(s).  The default account should then be disabled, and should not be used thereafter.  Please contact InferMed to obtain the password for the default user account.

.  Screen resolution of at least 1024x768 pixels.

.  Windows 2000 Professional or Windows XP.

.  Internet Explorer 5.5 or 6.0 (NOTE: IE 5.5 or 6.0 is required for online AND offline data entry and data review).



Database architecture.

.  One of Oracle 8.1.7, SQLSERVER 2000 or MSDE 2000 is required. Licences are required for each MACRO server and network client. Oracle client must be installed on each MACRO server and network client, including the OLE and ODBC components. Note that these components are not a part of the typical installation.  Oracle client requires 300 MB of free hard disk space.



Network.

.  A TCP/IP network is required for client/server configuration. If remote or web clients are to be used, each server will require an IP address. MACRO can be configured to work with most firewalls and proxy servers.
